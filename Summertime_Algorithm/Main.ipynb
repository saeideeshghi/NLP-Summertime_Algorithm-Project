      "  Combined Summary: Steven Gerrard's hopes of a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career were shattered as his side suffered a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The final on May 30, also by coincidence Gerrard's 35th birthday, would have been the midfielder's final game in a Liverpool shirt before he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer, but - although he was handed a starting role by manager Brendan Rodgers - he was unable to influence the outcome. Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation but midway through the first half, Liverpool adjusted their shape to 4-4-1-1, pushing Coutinho wide left and allowing Gerrard to adopt a more central position behind the striker. Liverpool lost 2-1 to Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Steven Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation.

One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is convinced there is more to come from striker Harry Kane after seeing him plunder his 30th goal of the season. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' Harry Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. ESPN's Britt McHenry was caught on tape berating an employee of a tow company. John Sutter: McHenry should have known better than to have used such words. He says we're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal.\n",

An unidentified male concert-goer has come under fire for his offensive choice of festival fashion.

      "  Combined Summary: Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences.\n",

However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device.

Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups. It's a point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the wage gap.\n",

He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. Sofia Davila, 21, posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook. She then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network. After meeting her victims, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystander.

      "  Combined Summary: Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage.\n",

In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani, has written the book 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Nayani was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. Nayani reveals that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. He also reveals that Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room.\n",

The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par.

      "  Combined Summary: Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could ‘go stale’ with age, a study warned. The AAT said the death of a ‘job for life’ meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Experts said training was ‘heavily geared’ towards young people. This left them vulnerable when companies start ‘shedding’ jobs. Over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 – and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s.\n",

While much of the interior city is in good condition, the outer wall is somewhat dilapidated and will be the focus of much of the work . The restoration work, which is due to be completed next year, will where possible be carried out in the style of Ming Dynasty architecture . Wanquan Castle, in China's northern Hebei province, was built in 1393. The fortress measures some two kilometres in circumference and was protected by an imposing 12-metre wall.

One vegetable picker working for a firm in Almeria supplying courgettes to the UK told of the filthy conditions in which he was made to work. It is up to them to know who is producing their food and in what conditions.’ Tory Neil Parish, a colleague on the committee, said: ‘There is always a price to pay for cheap imported food; whether it is poor quality, low animal welfare standards or, in this case, the appalling treatment of workers.’ More than 40 employment agencies supply labour to farm growers in the Murcia region. Migrant workers say they are denied basic hygiene facilities while working and are forced to use bushes near where the vegetables are being grown as toilets. They are not provided with soap or water to wash their hands, while some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in southern Spain. They claim they are treated like slaves by agencies who hire them to produce the salads and vegetables that end up on supermarket shelves in Britain.\n",

Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries. They found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics.\n",

ISIS has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya, where two governments backed by rival alliances of militias are battling each other as well as extremist groups. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that civilians are fleeing Ramadi as well as the three nearby villages captured by the IS group a few days ago. Video shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive. At least 16 men are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy.\n",

The people of Wirral West are not like that.’ She added: ‘The attacks have been misogynistic and sexist and I find it rather mystifying how the Labour party purports to be a party for a woman and yet have run this scurrilous campaign against me and at no time has it been condemned by Ed Miliband. She said: ‘Every time requires a different leader and hopefully in our lifetimes there will be time when another woman is needed as leader.’ As she hosted a women business leaders event in her constituency yesterday alongside Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Lords Leader Baroness Stowell, Miss McVey talked about the support she has received from other women in the Cabinet behind the scenes. Esther McVey won her Wirral West seat in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436. The employment minister also had an election song written about her by rivals claiming she was going to hell.

It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of \"religious liberty.\" That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this.

The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. Etan Patz's 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Pedro Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: But Iniesta capped an impressive 45 minutes in his side's Champions League quarter-final second-leg victory over PSG with a mesmeric run and pass for Neymar to score his first goal of the evening at the Camp Nou. We know that our presence in the semi-finals is important, though, and it's great that we made it that far.' Iniesta was replaced by Xavi at half-time, as Barcelona went on to complete a 5-1 aggregate victory that puts them in the draw for the Champions League semi-finals for the seventh time in eight years. Barcelona beat PSG 2-0 in Champions League quarter-final second leg. Andres Iniesta provided Neymar with his first goal on the night. The Spaniard had failed to register a single assist or goal from 19 La Liga appearances this season, prompting critics to suggest the 30-year-old was on the decline.\n",

But had you asked their fans at Wembley that day whether they would rather win the title or the FA Cup having knocked out Spurs, and many would have opted for the latter. It was, and still is. Tottenham Hotspur beat Arsenal 3-1 in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final. Paul Gascoigne scored a 35-yard free-kick that has gone down as one of the all-time great goals at Wembley. The goal set Spurs on their way to a victory, and they would go on to beat Nottingham Forest in the final.\n",

The Labour leader has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP in a hung Parliament, but he is likely to face calls from Ms Sturgeon to join a 'progressive alliance' to bring an immediate end to austerity, which is also backed by Plaid and the Greens. In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Prime Minister accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' He said the two parties were pretending to 'slug it out' ahead of next month's poll. But he insisted they were both working to ramp up spending regardless of deficit.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: The Labour leader  used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing North Africa could have been avoided if the Prime Minister had done more following his intervention in Libya to remove the former dictator Colonel Gaddafi. He said: 'Foreign policy is not something that you can just discover 13 days before polling day. 'All I would plead for is a little less finger-pointing wisdom from Ed Miliband - when he supported the intervention in the first place - and a little bit more adherence to facts about exactly who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can now do about it to stop this terrible tragedy,' he said. Labour leader accused PM of failing to secure a stable transfer of power. He said this failure had contributed to the crisis in North Africa. Up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach Europe this year. It comes after Cameron held emergency talks with EU leaders in Brussels.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Andy Flower, England team director who guided sides to three Ashes triumphs and the world No 1 spot, will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of England cricket. And his son Juan, who is living in England, isn’t waiting for the axe to fall on his father, having already made plans to take his wife and four children back to Chile. But that commitment should not prove an obstacle to him becoming director of England Cricket, a position for which he is one of the front-runners. Former England team director Andy Flower is now technical director of elite coaching at the ECB. Flower is effectively running the England cricket academy at Loughborough and working with young players in a coaching role. Kevin Pietersen is back playing cricket for Surrey in the hope of winning back a Test spot in the England side. Only the ECB’s hopeless media team could launch the domestic NatWest T20 Blast on the same day as an England Test match.\n",

Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs.

'After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for Finding Your Roots, it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves,' wrote Affleck. They have yet to release a statement on their findings or to make clear when they will be reported, and whether they will quiz Affleck. Ben Affleck today admitted the name of the slave ancestor he had censored from his past. The Oscar-winning actor posted on social media that a 'Benjamin Cole' of Georgia, an ancestor on his mother's side, was the relative dropped from the PBS show. The admission came the day after he apologized for lobbying for the removal of the truth about his family past from Finding Your Roots.

Hurst, a former corrections officer, then calmly proceeded to grab the man by the shoulder, bring him to the ground, put his hands behind his back and get on top of him until police arrived on the scene.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: The fund had been facing allegations of improper behavior after reports surfaced about undisclosed donations from foreign governments and a donor who was selling his uranium company to a Russian state agency at the same time the State Department had to approve the sale. Above, Giustra and Bill Clinton . The foundation, which was also placed on a watch list by the non-profit rating organization Charity Navigator, said that the excess money is in pledges rather than hard assets. Acting CEO Maura Pally apologized for 'mistakenly combined' grants and donations. She said the foundation would 'remedy' any errors but stressed the total revenue was reported accurately and that grants were properly broken out on audited statements. Pally said that money received from a businessman when he was seeking State Department approval for selling his company to Russia could not be disclosed under Canadian law. However, the tempered apology came the same day that a government watchdog said that the charity seemed like a 'slush fund' for one of America's most powerful political families.\n",

Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work . Chelsea beat Stoke 1-0 in their Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge.

      "  Combined Summary: The midfielder would go on to be a world-renowned, generational talent - but was only an emerging figure when, on the first day of the 1996-97 season, he spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line and arced the ball perfectly over him and into the net to round off a 3-0 win. The left-footed effort was into an empty net, with Luton keeper Marlon Beresford up for a corner in injury time of an FA Cup tie the Reds won 5-3, but he then launched a flat lob over Newcastle keeper Steve Harper from the edge of the centre circle inside his own half in the Premier League. Again, the Hannover goalkeeper was up for a free-kick, but that should not detract from Paderborn midfielder Stoppelkamp's achievement as the ball was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area and he simply controlled it on his chest, turned and volleyed the ball into the net from a scarcely believable 83 yards to make it 2-0. Charlie Adam scored from inside his own half against Chelsea on Saturday. David Beckham and Xabi Alonso have both scored from behind halfway.

However, in her report, Nicholas characterizes the officers words as an 'order' and the footage does not show her actually sitting in the hot car as police wrote her a ticket. While Nicholas argued she'd only been gone 10 minutes, the AVMA says that temperatures can rise 20F inside a car in that short amount of time. An Ohio woman was shocked this month when an officer cited her for leaving her dog in a hot car but, instead of writing a ticket, the cop forced her to sit inside to see how it feels. Last year, Shelly Nicholas in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico was told to sit in her hot car after her dog was found locked inside with no ventilation. While this may not be a legitimate police practice, officers have reason for concern in these situations, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: 'If the surface was magnetised, we would have expected to see a clear increase in the magnetic field readings as we got closer and closer to the surface,' said Auster. This leads scientists to believe that magnetic fields threading through the proto-planetary disc could have played an important role in moving material around as it started to clump together to form larger bodies. The findings are part of a series of scientific results obtained by scientists analyzing data collected by the Philae lander and its mothership Rosetta, which is flying alongside the comet on its elliptical orbit around the sun. Measurements made by the European space probe Philae, which landed on comet 67P in November, show the comet's core isn't magnetised. Some astrophysicists have suggested magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: An Afghan interpreter who risked his life on the front line with British troops was shot with his two-year-old son by Taliban hitmen after he says he was ‘abandoned’ by the UK Government. So far just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by the Taliban because of their work with British soldiers has been given a UK visa. A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 26-year-old, known as 'Chris' by UK soldiers, was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. His son Muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack, which Chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him.\n",

The Transportation Security Administration will 'enhance' officer training for hair pat-downs after complaints that African-American women were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings (file photo) According to an ACLU statement, TSA agents grabbed Singleton's hair, which was styled in tightly-wound 'sisterlocks,' and proceeded to 'squeeze it from top to bottom' at LAX airport. 'The humiliating experience on countless black women who are routinely targeted for hair pat-downs because their hair is \"different\" is not only wrong, but also a great misuse of TSA agents' time and resources,' Novella Coleman, Singleton's ACLU attorney, said in a statement. New training will commence at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.

      "  Combined Summary: It has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for more than 50 years. When Dr Pruetz and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded, however, they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps. Dr Pruetz added: 'What would often happen is the male would be in the vicinity of another chimp hunting with a tool, often a female, and the bush baby was able to escape the female and the male grabbed the bush baby as it fled.' Primatologists at Iowa State University recorded 300 hunts by chimps in Fongoli, Sénégal, and found female chimps were using tools to capture prey in 60 per cent of the observations. However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands. Research may also provide tantalising hints at how humans first learned to use weapons to hunt. It suggests that early female humans were perhaps the first to begin fashioning simple tools to help them catch prey.\n",

These are the first incredible pictures inside the melted nuclear reactor at Fukushima  power plant after the 2011 disaster . The nuclear plant is still being taken apart, and it is estimated it will take decades to make the area safe, as well as cost billions of pounds. Photographs were captured as part of the robot's mission to inspect melted fuel in one of the reactors. Developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, it was supposed to be able to function for about 10 hours at levels of radiation which would be fatal to humans. But decommissioning work at the plant suffered a setback after the adaptable 'transformer' robot stalled before it could complete its operation and had to be abandoned. A second robot mission scheduled for Monday was postponed as engineers investigated the cause of the malfunction.\n",

Gary Deegan caught Dens defender Gary Irvine high on his right shin. Referee Craig Charleston saw an incident, but not the gory details. The official had his view obstructed by bodies and because of that the SFA could take no action. The governing body immediately took the stance they *should* be allowed to use video evidence to review incidents the referee had clearly missed. They altered the rules.

Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . Robert Bates, 73, appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter over the death of Eric Harris. In 2009, the Tulsa Sheriff's Office concluded after an internal investigation that Bates had received special treatment during training and while working as a reserve deputy. He was said to have used his personal car while on duty and made unauthorized vehicle stops.\n",

Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. ‘They kept the kids for hours,’ a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son Rafi, 10, and daughter Dvora, 6, to roam free in their suburban neighborhood. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. But the parents say authorities crossed a line over the weekend and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Where they differ is on the role of now-45-year-old Gianni Van in the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez, whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of a road. After the killing, Van and Esparza — who had been questioned by police — entered into a sham marriage to avoid prosecution, Murray said. While Van was arrested in 1996, he was released because Esparza could not be forced to testify against her husband, he said. Gianni Van, 45, is accused of the 1995 murder of 24-year-old Gonzalo Ramirez, whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of a road. Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza. Van's lawyer said his client had no knowledge of the plan to harm Ramirez and was threatened that he would suffer a similar fate if he snitched on a friend and friend's employee who carried out the killing. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Chelsea star Hazard tucks the ball behind his standing leg in the latest attempt to fool a defender.... ...and it's successful, as he breezes past his man who ends up running completely the wrong way . Chelsea's star man has 19 goals in all competitions so far this season and will be confident of reaching the 20-goal mark at the Emirates after notching in the 1-0 win over Manchester United on Saturday. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane (right) commented on his admiration for Hazard on Wednesday . Eden Hazard was being filmed as part of a feature for Rio Ferdinand's '5' magazine. The Chelsea star left a defender in knots with his fancy footwork as he handed out a lesson in ball control. Hazard will be a key man for Jose Mourinho's side as they travel to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday looking for a win.\n",

I did not know who they [the organisers] were. Mr Hussen said he felt ‘terrible’ to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby’s killers and said: ‘It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. Abase Hussen took his daughter Amira to an extremist rally when she was 13. The teenager fled to Syria to become a 'jihadi bride' earlier this year. Mr Hussen was caught on video at a violent protest in London in 2012. He has now admitted he went to two further rallies with his daughter in tow.\n",

Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The camel was likely used in the 1683 Battle of Vienna, which took place on 11 September after Vienna had been seiged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. Discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. They believe the camel may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated.\n",

Row: The Dome of the Rock is one of the most contentious religious spots in all of Jerusalem, and the argument over the carpet is simply the latest in a long line of battle between Muslim and Jewish groups . This is not the first time tensions have flared over work at the Dome of the Rock. Work at the Dome of the Rock was simply meant to replace carpet worn away by thousands of pilgrims at the gold-topped shrine. But when the old carpet was lifted, it revealed previously undocumented ancient floor designs. Could point to where gold-cased Ark of the Covenant was buried 2,500 years ago. Discovery has sparked a war of words between the Muslim authority that administers the Al Aqsa Mosque compound and Israeli archaeologists. Scholars say they did not get the chance to document the designs before workmen began laying the new carpet.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: ‘We now intend to extend this collaboration and advance Sulforadex into a clinical trial with breast cancer patients.’ Katie Goates, at Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘While it’s important to remember that at this stage research has only been carried out in mice, this new combination of drugs shows exciting potential to overcome resistance to hormone treatments, such as tamoxifen. ‘Interestingly, Dr Clarke’s team has also shown that this combination of drugs reduces the number of cancer stem cells in secondary breast cancer samples. ‘This means that the combination also has the potential to extend how long tamoxifen treatment can work for women with secondary breast cancer (cancer that has spread), the incurable form of the disease. Cancer that has spread and is incurable, known as secondary breast cancer, kills 1,000 women in Britain every month. New approach will target cancer stem cells that evade conventional drugs and cause the tumour to re-grow. Researchers from Manchester University working with drug development company Evgen Pharma, have developed a new combination of drugs which could overcome this problem. They are testing the drug Sulforadex in the most common type of breast cancer.\n",

'The vast majority of dog owners in Barking and Dagenham are socially responsible but unfortunately a selfish few think it's ok to not clean up after their pet. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Civic Centre pictured, will become the first in the UK to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines . The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to submit a DNA sample from the inside of the animal's cheek so it is registered on a database. The council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets. The laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate. Similar schemes in the US have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent.\n",

It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw with Fleetwood Town. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.

      "  Combined Summary: (CNN)A jury of Rolling Stone's media peers has dissected the magazine's disastrous, discredited story about rape on the campus of the University of Virginia, and the emerging consensus is that Rolling Stone's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough, devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Rolling Stone writer Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations; she never spoke to three of Jackie's friends who allegedly talked with Jackie immediately after the attack, and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond, refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when. At a minimum, they should heed the wise counsel of my friend Bill Grueskin, an executive editor at Bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the Columbia J-school. Rolling Stone published a story about a rape on the campus of the University of Virginia. The story was retracted after a Washington Post reporter took a closer look. A review by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: A first-half strike by the outstanding Aaron Ramsey was enough to see off Burnley at an intimidating Turf Moor and record an eighth win in a row by Arsene Wenger's side, the best run since The Invincibles team managed it in 2004. 'There wasn't a lot in the game and it was close against Manchester City and Chelsea too. They are bringing on a Danny Welbeck as a £16million substitute, that's not bad. Aaron Ramsey fired Arsenal into a 1-0 lead in the 12th minute at Turf Moor. The Welsh midfielder scored his ninth goal of the season in the process. Arsenal have now won eight games in a row for the first time since 2004. Arsene Wenger's side have won at Sunderland, Newcastle, Manchester City and now Burnley.\n",

The Statesman reported that the kick and shooting from a moving vehicle don't specifically violate the Texas Department of Public Safety rules for high-speed chases, but experts said that shooting at fleeing suspects was an area of the policy that needed updating. Trooper Abraham Martinez leaped into the air and kicked motorcyclist Steven Gaydos after he fled from authorities in Houston in 2012.

      "  Combined Summary: This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. It is eight long, barren years since an English club claimed the top prize in European rugby and the bookmakers aren't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs.\n",

The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. Pep Guardiola split his pants during Bayern Munich's 6-1 win over Porto. The Spanish tactician wore a tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt. He joked: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match' Other stars guilty of going too tight include Russell Brand, Dermot O'Leary and Olly Murs.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Mr Miliband initially suggested he would 'abolish' non-dom status – but it later emerged that Labour is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Last year, Mr Osborne announced a new £90,000 annual charge for people who are non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes but have lived here for 17 of the past 20 years. Miliband announced plans to overhaul Britain's non-domicile regime. It allows 116,000 foreigners and people with foreign links to pay tax only on money that they bring into Britain. Labour aides suggested the change in the rules would raise as much as £1billion. Tax advisers immediately disputed this, saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums.\n",

And when it comes to women, the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision, one where some women say life is simply not worth living. Frida Ghitis: ISIS and Boko Haram have a strategy beyond the battlefield. She says their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their radical strategy. Ghitis says ISIS is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women is in keeping with Islamic law.\n",

Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th Masters at Augusta on Thursday. Dustin Johnson is the best American but Henrik Stenson will be hoping to mount a serious challenge. Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action.

Vigorous pursuit: NSW Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing (pictured) revealed on Friday that police are investigating William Tyrrell's disappearance at a very fast pace and that 'one of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring' A new home video of cheeky William Tyrrell (pictured, eating cake) has been provided by the family in their desperate wait for the return of the three-year-old, seven months after his probable kidnap . William Tyrrell's parents released this new photo (above) of their missing son, with an impassioned plea in which his mother said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... and has gone \"clump\" on his shoulders' Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search the murky dam in a bush reserve, and a nearby swamp . Police have revealed that they believe missing toddler William Tyrell may be alive, despite fears that he was abducted by a paedophile ring. 'The two worlds collided. We have information that could link William’s disappearance to a group of people suspected of paedophile activity,' said lead investigator Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin. This comes as the three-year-old's mother spoke out about the horrifying moment she realised her son had vanished. She said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... has gone `clump' on his shoulders, picked him up and moved him on.\n",

I will be forced to abandon my home and my life just so that he can return … I can’t see the justice in that and I want to know why the rights of a man who tortured me for so long are more important than mine.’ Miss Dunford’s problems with Ward began when she put a gate across a lane shared by their properties. Mandy Dunford, 54, was followed around her farm in the North Yorkshire Moors by Kenneth Ward, 67, naked apart from socks and boots. The military historian even performed sex acts in front of her. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. A judge at Teesside Crown Court also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning the flasher from being within 200 metres of Miss Dunford. But Ward has successfully appealed to have the restraining order overturned.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward. Manchester City have been limited to a net transfer spend of £49million in the last two transfer windows. The Premier League champions were punished by UEFA for breaching financial fairplay regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the restrictions will be lifted at the end of this season.

One of the reasons the Overcomers decided to leave Gloriavale was to spend more time with their children, rather than them being 'raised as a part of a system' Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up. 'He was out for six months, away from his wife and family. Elijah Overcomer, 26, and his wife Rosanna, 29, left New Zealand's Gloriavale commune in late March 2013. The couple and their three children were 'blown away' by the kindness and support shown to them by churches in Christchurch and Timaru. Gloriavale is a secretive Christian commune where everyone wears blue uniforms and birth control is non-existent. The Overcomers were also forced to grapple with their views of the greater world.\n",

Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. Typhoon Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday.

The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . Mrs Walters also texted a relative of one of her sons just an hour before the crash to say: ‘I need him arrested when I get back, but I am scared because he is so volatile and I don’t want to wind him up.’ The couple were returning to their home in Swindon when Walters suddenly swerved his car off the carriageway and into a tree. Tracy Walters, 48, died after her husband Ian's car veered off the M1 motorway. He is accused of deliberately smashing his 4x4 vehicle into a tree at 84mph. Mrs Walters, a keen horse rider, was flown to hospital but died two days later. The couple had a 'troubled' relationship, with Mrs Walters telling relatives and police that her husband had been abusive to her. But giving evidence yesterday, Walters described his love life with Tracy as ‘very fulfilling’\n",

In this image is one Google's autonomous vehicles pictured with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (right) Last year, for instance, ride-sharing service Uber said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles. Study by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development used data from Lisbon in Portugal. By plugging the data into a computer model, they simulated how such self-driving, communal cabs would affect traffic. Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. Finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis.\n",

Yesterday, Katie and her mother Eve Cope, 60, told of their fury at the police’s response and accused officers of giving a ‘green light’ to shoplifters by merely cautioning the 66-year-old culprit. She didn’t apologise and when police eventually got here she lied about her age and her name three times.’ Officers arrived within nine minutes after Mrs Cope, pictured outside her store, made a formal complaint . Katie Cope, 17, said she feared being assaulted by the agitated woman. She had to close the shop and put down the electronic shutter after the thief became abusive towards other customers and kept trying to leave. When police finally got to the vintage clothing store, they said the stolen knickers, which had been reduced to £1, were not worth enough to prosecute.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: A telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by NHS doctors, cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes. He adds: ‘The trial showed that the new procedure is quicker and better – it halves the time to the start of treatment at no additional cost.’ BBC political editor Nick Robinson announced that doctors found a tumour on his lung earlier this year . Her doctors could not be sure what type of cancer it was without investigating further, so they recommended she have the pioneering EBUS procedure. A finger-width flexible tube called an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and take a tissue sample in one go. The procedure involves inserting the EBUS down the throat, guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube. Findings from a three-year trial at UCLH reveal that the method halves the time it takes between a patient’s first hospital appointment and for a decision to be made on the best course of treatment.\n",

The original garage doors open into two distinct living areas while the living quarters upstairs offer three sprawling bedrooms with  open fireplaces, stunning wooden floors and vaulted ceilings. The property will open its doors to prospective buyers on Wednesday 22 April before the hammer falls on May 16. The converted four-bedroom home on Lawrenny Court was built as a garage to service the generous 57-room mansion Homeden. Around 25 years ago, the distinctive Toorak home was thoughtfully converted into the polished residence it is today. The conversion took place at the same time Homeden was being tuned into a block of flats providing the owners with a unique opportunity to buy some of the original features of the mansion. The house will be opened to prospective buyers on 22 April and is set to go under the hammer on 16 May.\n",

The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean . It’s a very interesting find.’ Phil Harding of the Saltford Environment Group, said that the coin’s significant because it is one of the oldest coins ever to be found in England. Copper coin dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago. It was found in silt after the River Avon burst its banks between Bristol and Bath. On one side there is a horse’s head, while the other bears the image of the goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage. Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean. The find suggests that the village of Saltford, where it was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times.\n",

The Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported. Stormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured) Gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. Tate Britain chiefs believe chance discovery of 1946 export permit will bolster claim that Beaching A Boat, Brighton was legitimately brought to Britain. 1946 document bears signature of dealer called Karola Fabri and seeks permission for transfer of artworks from Budapest to Zurich. Discovery of permit in archives of Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts is latest twist in dispute between Tate and descendants of original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958.\n",

Finally, last month the state Supreme Court ruled that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. His supporters and attorneys say Lapointe could not have committed the crime due to his disabilities. Richard Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989. He was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole.

      "  Combined Summary: But the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels, so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years. A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground . The latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km) (illustrated) To discover the large chamber (shown in yellow), the University of Utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes. A supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day. A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels. Now, geophysicists have found the source in a secondary chamber deeper underground. This is so large its partly-molten rock could fill the Grand Canyon 11 times over. It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath Yellowstone and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km) Lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, researchers said.\n",

It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. Cynthia Cheroitich hid in her room for two days after the attack. \"I was scared so much,\" she tells CNN. Kenya's president declares three days of national mourning for the victims.\n",

'What the Clinton Foundation has said is that we will be even more transparent' in the wake of the scandalous claims, said Chelsea, the philanthropy's vice chair, 'even though Transparency International and others have said we're among the most transparent of foundations.'

      "  Combined Summary: And concerns are so great that one security source has warned: ‘However much physical security you have, if someone is already in there, there’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism.’ MI5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘insiders’ – highlighted by the Germanwings disaster. ‘There is no testing regarding mental health.’ A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. Now ‘‘the insider’’ is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services. It comes after suicide pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster.

Police said the alleged plot could have been executed any time in the next week after they found knifes and swords in the teenager's homes and it emerged that they were scouting police stations in the run-up to their attack. Just two days before 18-year-old Sevdet was arrested at his Melbourne home on Saturday, he was perusing the Facebook page of Junaid Thorne. A third man has been charged after raids in Melbourne led police to foil an Anzac Day terror plot. The 18-year-old Hampton Park man had his Preventative Detention Order removed, and the teenager was re-arrested. The man has now been charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' It comes as a British teenager has been arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during the First World War commemorations.

      "  Combined Summary: Conducting the ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington, near York, the French Ambassador Sylvie Bermann told the frail veterans: ‘I am here in recognition of your heroic accomplishments in the liberation of France and to honour your bravery and dedication.’ Aged between 90 and 99, they are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come. ‘On D-Day I should have been the last one in the boat to be the first one out because I was carrying a charge to blow up a pill box,’ he recalled. Commenting on yesterday’s award, the 90-year-old widower from York said: ‘It’s a great honour, but there are far more deserving souls who didn’t get it.’ ERIC GILL was a veteran of the Burma campaign when he landed on a beach in Normandy. The five men each played their own vital role in the Normandy campaign that began with the D-Day landings. Two were just teenagers, another was a young sapper, one a rookie tank driver and the last was a veteran of jungle warfare.

      "  Combined Summary: That's according to a study that found almost 30 million health records nationwide were involved in criminal theft, malicious hacking or other data breaches over four years. 'Our study demonstrates that data breaches have been and will continue to be a persistent threat to patients, clinicians, and health care systems,' Liu said. Patients should be alert to cyber threats, including 'phishing' emails from hackers posing as doctors, hospitals or health insurance companies, said Lisa Gallagher, a cybersecurity expert at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. Compromised information included patients' names, home addresses, ages, illnesses, test results or Social Security numbers. Most involved electronic data and theft, including stolen laptops and computer thumb drives. Hackings doubled during the study, from almost 5 percent of incidents in 2010 to almost 9 percent in 2013. Cyber-security experts say thieves may try to use patients' personal information to fraudulently obtain medical services.\n",

On my last evening, a group of villagers came to the hotel to entertain us. When I came to leave the group the next morning, I had to sign a release form saying I was responsible for my own actions, which made my trip to the festival seem more adventurous than it really was. Bulgarian folklore is genuine and not just put on for tourists. Almost every village in the mountains has at least one choir. Many hold festivals in the way that English villages stage fetes.

      "  Combined Summary: Local business owners have labelled Surfers Paradise Meter Maids as outdated and were no longer providing a service . Mr Yared said Meter Maids were no longer relevant as parking meters were now electronic and they had not kept up with the changing times. 'Meter Maids invoke in most people that wonderful memory of that beachside holiday in Surfers Paradise,' he said. Meter Maids started in 1965 to stave off bad publicity associated with parking meters on the Gold Coast. The controversial move involved young women dressed in gold bikinis walking the main tourist strip and placing money into expired meters. Local business owners say the group is no longer performing a public service as advancements in parking meter technology mean expiry times are not always displayed. They believe Meter Maids are violating the council's anti-touting laws by spruiking branded merchandise.\n",

Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love injured his left shoulder during the first half in game four of the first round of the NBA Playoffs against the Boston Celtics on Sunday . 'Olynyk was in a compromising position, had no chance to get the ball, and it was just too bad that he would go to those lengths to take somebody out of a game.' Cleveland's power forward was injured in the first quarter of the Cavaliers' 101-93 victory that completed a four-game sweep. Love and Boston's Kelly Olynyk chased a loose ball into the left corner after Jae Crowder of the Celtics missed a 3-pointer. Love then grabbed his arm and kept running toward the Cleveland bench before going to the locker room, where he iced his shoulder. 'I thought it was a bush-league play,' Love said after the game while wearing a sling.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Mr Miliband said he favoured 'basically four boats' but it was 'right to have a review' while Labour treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said that maintaining four submarines was 'exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time'. 'Unless we are absolutely sure where they would be then we have to assume that they are not fit to protect this country by having a continuous nuclear deterrent,' he said 'In a very dangerous world that is a very dangerous position.' Miss Sturgeon said: 'We would never be in any deal with a Labour government who is going to renew Trident.' Tories claim Russian leader Vladimir Putin would be happy with Ed Miliband as prime minister because he cannot be trusted to keep our Trident submarines. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon led a ferocious assault on the Labour leader.

      "  Combined Summary: The High Court heard concerns by defence lawyers that Mr Graham may have used his political influence to try to get the trial switched from Bristol. They also argued that a number of his Twitter posts could prejudice the trial if not removed from his Twitter account. Barrister Stephen Kamlish QC, acting for the defendant in the murder trial, said in court that Mr Graham’s tweets were a ‘clear attempt to win votes by ingratiating himself with his electors’, the MP was ‘potentially out of control on the issue’ and if he refused to remove his tweets or added to them, the defendant may not get a fair trial. Richard Graham is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester. He faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down the Twitter posts. The Old Etonian former diplomat was accused of posting the tweets to ‘ingratiate himself’ with voters.\n",

The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. He was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman.\n",

So here is this continent where you have all the raw material and the know-how, but what is missing is the link to luxury. African metropolises have seen some of the highest growth in the number of millionaires on the continent.

'When Hillary Clinton travels there's going to need to be two planes, one for her and her entourage, one for her baggage,' Paul said during remarks at a New Hampshire GOP summit taking place in Nashua this weekend. Rubio and Cruz are also in town for the summit. 'I'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering,' Paul said, predicting that she'd soon have new questions to answer about her family foundation's donations from foreign actors. Clinton embarked on a cross-country trip in an armored van she nicknamed 'Scooby' last weekend for the first leg of her presidential bid. Paul has been suggesting since he announced his bid for the Oval Office in early April that Clinton would 'soon' face a day of reckoning over the charity's fundraising practices.

This news comes just days after the 22-year-old's loved ones were split over whether she had awoken from her coma as her father had claimed. While over the weekend Bobby claimed his daughter was awake, her maternal grandmother Cissy Houston clarified to People that her granddaughter 'is no longer in a medically induced coma'\n",

Sagna departed Arsenal on the back of winning the FA Cup but faces a year without a trophy at City . 'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News.

      "  Combined Summary: Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven naïve, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is, but as they hope it could be. AQAP is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al Qaeda writ large, and the Obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al Qaeda's global network. And, although ISIS is trying to \"out al Qaeda\" al Qaeda, resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world, al Qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the United States and our allies today than it was in January 2014. David Rothkopf: President Obama refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century. He says the Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater.\n",

Their findings found that women who had been treated with tamoxifen - and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day - had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all. ‘We saw that this was already the case at the time of diagnosis.’ The study also found that breast cancer cells react with caffeine and caffeic acid, which are both found in the hot drink. Tamoxifen kills off cancer cells or stunts their growth by blocking the cancer-causing hormone oestrogen from reaching diseased cells. When combined with two cups coffee, it can be even more effective, according to a study of 1,090 breast cancer patients by British and Swedish researchers.\n",

Fire boat Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade in 1940 and transported to Dunkirk to help with the evacuation of Allied troops in the face of the Nazi advance. Saying goodbye: The Massey Shaw pictured on its final voyage before being decommissioned as a fire boat in 1971 . Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade in 1940. It was transported to Dunkirk to help with the evacuation of Allied troops. After carrying 600 soldiers back to Britain, the boat returned to London. It is still capable of pumping out 3,000 gallons of water every minute - as much as four fire engines - despite being 80 years old. The boat went out of service in 1971, and four decades was used as a walkway in a London dock, allowing people to get to other bessels.\n",

Spider crabs are easy to find during their migration as they are usually present in shallow water of two metres or more. The creatures were discovered at Blairgowrie Pier but are fast on the move to their proper migration at Rye Pier in a few weeks time. Spider crabs migrate once a year in the Port Phillip Bay area in Southern Victoria, piling on top of each other to create a moving mound. The full migration is expected to occur in two to five weeks when the water temperature will drop to 14 degrees.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Neville wrote in his Telegraph column that should a player such as Paul Pogba or Mats Hummels decide on a move to England, they are unlikely to select the Etihad as their destination - now that Manuel Pellegrini's side have been reined in by Financial Fair Play. 'When United were faced with the Doomsday scenario of being out of the Champions League last summer, they had to blitz the market to sign the likes of Angel di Maria, simply because they had to throw money at the problem they found themselves in. 'And that is big issue facing City this summer -- United, Chelsea and Arsenal are now all capable of taking them on in the transfer market and, if a player has a straight choice between the four clubs, City will come fourth every time.' Gary Neville believes a star player will always choose Manchester City last if they have a straight choice between the big clubs in the Premier League. The former Manchester United defender believes his former club, Chelsea and Arsenal would be a preferable option now for a big star looking to switch to England. Neville believes Manchester City need to be bold and take on UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations.\n",

Mr Lawrence said doctors and psychologists have recommended that she be released and that she shouldn't be returned to Nauru because of her post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder. 'The government have got a child who has been damaged in their detention facility and they know she's been damaged in their facility, she's psychologically seriously damaged and shouldn't be returned to Nauru.' A five-year-old Iranian girl has spent more than a year in Australia's offshore Nauru detention centre. She has been prescribed anti-depressants, has self-harmed by swallowing shampoo and nails and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, her lawyer says. She is now living in fear of being returned to the troubled island for years while her family's asylum claim is processed.

Even for healthy people sarcasm can be hard to detect and some cultures use it far more than others. Stroke patients with damage to the right sagittal stratum in the right hemisphere of the brain were far poorer at detecting sarcasm when listening to sentences, according to the new research. Researchers claim that being exposed to sarcasm required more ‘cognitive complexity’, or the ability to see things from more than one angle.

      "  Combined Summary: The Homeless Period campaign shines a spotlight on the plight of women living on the streets who don't have access to proper sanitary care during their periods . Patricia, who used to sleep on the 137 bus in Brixton Hill, says that when her period came, she would use 'ripped up cloth' as a  sanitary towel. Supporters have been dropping boxes of tampons and towels into their local homeless shelters, with one donor, Sarah Wyatt, so inspired that she has set up a crowd-funding page to encourage more people to donate. Homeless Period project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle. A campaign video tells the story of a woman called Patricia, who slept rough in Brixton for six months and was forced to use 'ripped up cloth' as a makeshift sanitary towel. Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty wrote hard-hitting messages on cardboard boxes and photographed them on streets of London.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in Hatton Garden, as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in Los Angeles in the 1980s. They then used concrete drills and saws to cut a 20ft-by-25ft hole in the floor of the vault, before clambering through and ransacking the safety deposit boxes. Again, the group had used heavy tools to cut their way into a bank vault over the course of a weekend, and again they had set off an alarm on their way in. Officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad released images of three suspects. But they refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader. Criminologist Richard Hoskins said he has identified 'startling similarities' between the Hatton Garden raid and novel Black Echo, by Michael Connelly. The novel was based on real-life bank robbers dubbed 'The Hole In The Ground Gang' who struck three vaults in LA in 1986 and 1987. In the 1986 robbery, the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend, triggering alarms on the Friday that were not investigated. It was not until the week following the raids that police\n",

But they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) - full of hero worship and pin-up pictures of the Fuhrer, published by his fervent henchman Baldur von Shirach. The theatrical wartime leader’s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler’s own use, but they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) His poetic fawning continues page after page, but the magazine is nonetheless a compelling read thanks to the ludicrous vanity of the Fuhrer photos. Rare archive photo and several other portraits have been discovered in a Hitler ‘fan magazine’ from the Thirties. Hitler seems ill at ease with his hands, squeezing them into his tight lederhosen pockets in one photo, and perching them awkwardly on his hips in another.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: When you’re going so late into the game and Christian’s had to pull that one out of the bag, we’re grateful for that.’ Chris Ramsey was equally frustrated that his team only took a point from Villa Park, having twice led, initially through Matt Phillips’ header. His free-kick was a fantastic strike in off the post against a top keeper, who had it been anywhere else probably would have saved it.’ The QPR head coach added: ‘Based on the way we played in the second half and the beginning of the first half you have to be disappointed you haven’t been able to get above the line, which was the aim before we started the last two games. I don’t know what we need but we’re probably going to have to win three games. Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 with QPR. QPR had led through Matt Phillips and Charlie Austin. Villa boss Tim Sherwood said the point could be a vital one for his side.\n",

America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less. Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, announced he's running for president. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype.\n",

Unfortunately, rather than expanding national attention to encompass the dangers of both radical Islam and right-wing extremism, the 9/11 attacks simply shifted attention away from the extreme right. However, during the past six years, from 2009 through 2014, right-wing extremists in the U.S. were involved in at least 42 actual or attempted terrorist acts. 20 years ago, Timothy McVeigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The attack killed 168 men, women and children, injured hundreds more. The public became aware of the true danger of the extreme right.\n",

Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour three weeks ago. The 18-year-old was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. His girlfriend Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery.

She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on  bail for charges relating to the first two students. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Brianne Altice, 35, was ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Utah school district accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher. The latest lawsuit, filed last week, describes how Altice began flirting with the student, then 16, and other boys in her class.

The Red Cross has warned of a 'catastrophic' situation in main southern city Aden where militia loyal to fugitive President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi have been holding out against Houthi Shiite rebels and their allies within the security forces. The main Shiite power Iran, which has strongly opposed the Saudi-led intervention, stepped up its efforts for a negotiated settlement with a visit to Saudi ally Pakistan by Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif. The Alborz destroyer and Bushehr support vessel sailed from Bandar Abbas to the Gulf of Aden today. Military bosses claim the move is designed to protect Iranian shipping from piracy. It comes as Saudi Arabia continues to lead a bombing campaign to oust the Iran-allied Houthi movement which has taken most of Yemen.\n",

When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. Len McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics. They seek to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s.

They’re all easy to reach, require no deep knowledge, and the wildlife is as reliable as a wild thing can be.\n",

Suarez started the season late because of his FIFA ban and, on his own admission, was anxious in front of goal when he first joined Neymar and Lionel Messi – too conscious of the need not to appear greedy in the company of two world-class finishers. 'We have seen him do it before for Ajax and Liverpool,' said Luis Enrique after Wednesday's game. Luis Suarez scored twice as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0. The Uruguayan has now scored 13 goals in his last 14 games. Suarez's relationship with Lionel Messi both on and off the field has blossomed in recent months.\n",

Bitter battle: March, 40, is contesting the prenuptial agreement the couple signed ahead of their marriage that means the famous chef, who's worth about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 a month in alimony . The Food Network chef filed court documents filed on April 10 saying that his 10-year marriage has 'irretrievably broken down.' The celebrity chef's business partner Laurence Kretchmer moved swiftly to dismiss the claims, saying that if Flay, 50, had been having an ongoing affair with an employee, he would know about it. Page Six claimed Flay has been seeing Tirrel, who's 28, for three years and that according to a friend of March, the actress learned of the relationship with the former hostess just after Thanksgiving 2014. March's friend Maia Madison, a writer and actress, told Page Six that March arrived 'sobbing uncontrollably' at her home after finding out about the affair.\n",

The Glass House in Chislehurst, which was formerly a secret Cold War bunker and has now been transformed and is up for sale for £3.5million . As well as a sun room, the house also has a roof terrace. The property, in the leafy south east London suburb of Chislehurst, was designed and built especially for government officials as the Cold War intensified in 1951. The site was chosen because the wooden area surrounding the building afforded it secrecy and the house was built with five foot thick concrete walls. It took two years to totally renovate the property as workers were forced to carve windows and doors out of the formidable concrete. The house now boasts five bedrooms, a stylish kitchen, games room and outside roof terrace.\n",

'We don't know if planets are more common in our galaxy's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy, which is why these observations are so important,' she added. The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile. The planet is half as massive as Jupiter and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the Milky Way. It was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer.\n",

'If we arrived at a place where the bill that is passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support is essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions - not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement - that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we've expressed about the authority that is exercised by the President of the United States to conduct foreign policy,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. 'I rather think what we would find ourselves with is the kind of compromise that the president would be willing to sign,' Earnest explained. Senate committee voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks, and left in a signature feature of the bill giving Congress the authority to approve a final deal with Iran. It now goes to the full Senate, where it is could pass with a veto-proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers. The Obama administration was in panic-mode this week, trying to strike a last-minute deal with legislators on both sides of the aisle.\n",

'Whenever the issue of St George's Day comes up - and I can predict this on Twitter today - there will be many left-centre people who will tweet the fact that St George was from what's today known as Turkey as if that is the start, finish of conversation and that makes St George's Day irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous. Patriotic countrymen and women turned out in their finest red and white today to enjoy St George's Day celebrations in the sunshine. Veteran parades and Morris men were seen across the country, with spectators draped in flags cheering them on.

      "  Combined Summary: Ali Alfoneh of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said his group is 'concerned the Obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal, that Washington will give more concessions to Tehran' 'No such agreement has been made,' Dehquan said. Israeli defense official Amos Gilad predicted that when Iranian sanctions are dropped, 'they will get rich' and 'will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets' Khamenei is now saying no foreign inspectors, including those from the IAEA, will be allowed to tour the military facilities where Iran's nuclear operations are housed . France, which has demanded more stringent conditions on Iran, said the comments by the Iranian leadership showed that reaching a final deal would be difficult and that in any case there would need to be a mechanism in place to restore sanctions if Tehran violated its commitments. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first comments on the interim deal reached last week in the Swiss city of Lausanne. In remarks apparently meant to keep hardline loyalists in line, he warned about 'deceptive' intentions of the United States. 'Instant annulment of all sanction is one of the demands of our officials,' Khamenei said in a speech broadcast live on state television. But he hedged on whether there will be a deal in place at all by the June 30 deadline. 'I neither support nor oppose the deal, since nothing has happened yet,' he said.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: A rising demand for memory chips is said to be helping offset a slump in the firm's smartphone sales, but profits are predicted to be 30.5 per cent down compared to this time last year. This led to Samsung releasing its own video, demonstrating a three-point bend test on both its Galaxy S6 models. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung has previously supplied Apple with various iPhone parts. But following legal disputes, Apple signed a monopoly deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 2013. From next year, Samsung will supply 80% of Apple's supply of application processors, with TSMC supplying the remaining 20%. The deal is said to be worth 'billions of dollars'\n",

'Victims of child sex abuse are being let down when alongside a 60 per cent increase in reports there has been a nine per cent drop in arrests for child sex abuse, as well as falling prosecutions and convictions for child abuse offences as the police are unable to keep up.' Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures were a 'national scandal' 'Since the Operation Yewtree police investigation was launched in 2012, the NSPCC helpline has seen a huge rise in the number of victims willing to speak out, get support and help bring abusers to justice. Nearly 9,000 reports of child sex abuse were filed with police in 2014. South Yorkshire saw the largest rise with 577 per cent increase in five years. But the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, figures reveal. Critics have accused the Government of failing victims of abuse.\n",

Nicola Sturgeon said she would back calls for all tax powers to be devolved. But Labour leader Jim Murphy warned this would leave a £7.6billion black hole.

      "  Combined Summary: (CNN)Americans on the United States' no-fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status, according to court documents filed by the Justice Department this week. \"The U.S. government is making enhancements to the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to provide additional transparency and process for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the No Fly List,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. The 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge. U.S. no-fly list travelers will now be given information about why they have been banned from commercial flights. The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: House leaders have reached a bipartisan compromise on a bill that would end the National Security Agency's controversial collection of American phone records, but the measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee chairman, Virginia Republican Rep.  Bob Goodlatte, said the bill's provisions had been carefully negotiated with both the intelligence committee and intelligence agencies. Some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill's civil liberties provisions, but those were voted down, with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue NSA phone records collection. The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday overwhelmingly passed the latest version of a bill known as the USA Freedom Act by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. The measure seeks to codify President Barack Obama's proposal to end the NSA's collection of domestic calling records. It would allow the agency to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations. The authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act will expire June 1 unless Congress passes a law reauthorizing it. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Democrat Patrick Leahy and Republican Mike Lee. But Republican Senate Majority\n",

City were up and running and when Toure scored from 30 yards at Newcastle a year later, a first Premier League title was on its way. His manager Manuel Pellegrini hasn't always helped by asking him to play as part of a holding two in midfield when it has been apparent for a while that he is now most effective as a modern day number ten, free of defensive obligations. Yaya Toure has been linked with a move away from Manchester City. The Ivorian has struggled to impose himself at the Etihad this season. Toure signed for City for a fee of £24million from Barcelona in 2010. The midfielder has been a key part of City's Premier League success.\n",

David Meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after McShane pulled a goal back for a lunge on Kyle Naughton . Ki Sung-Yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis scored for Swansea in the first half. Paul McShane pulled a goal back for Hull five minutes into the second half. David Meyler was sent off two minutes later for fouling Kyle Naughton. The 29-year-old grabbed his second of the match in injury time.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Such was the control Leinster had been able to exert on Bath in an utterly one-sided first half punctuated only by a single piece of individual brilliance by fly-half George Ford, it was impossible to see a way back into the contest for the West Countrymen. Had it not been for a penalty conceded by replacement Matt Garvey with seconds on the clock, they may well have won. With 47 minutes gone, and Leinster winger Fergus McFadden off the field with a concussion sustained in a tackle from Kyle Eastmond, Ford produced his second moment of magic. Bath fly half George Ford scored the only try of the game in the first-half. Ian Madigan kicked six penalties for Leinster as they led 15-5 at half-time. Anthony Watson was sent to the sin-bin for a reckless aerial challenge on Rob Kearney. Ford scored Bath's second try after another dazzling break from the England No 10. Bath lock Stuart Hooper crashed over for his side's third try.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: AP McCoy’s last chance of a National winner before he retires has evaporated after Benvolio, his intended mount in this afternoon’s Coral Scottish National at Ayr was withdrawn. McCoy, who recorded the 4,348th win when successful on Capard King at Ayr, said: ‘It is disappointing not to be riding in the Scottish National but the ground was going to be too quick for Benvolio and, sadly, I couldn't do the weight on any of the others.’ McCoy has three rides at Ayr today - Sea Lord, Upsilon Bleu and Lettheriverrundry – but then is not expected to ride again until the Sandown next weekend. This race will take the freshness out of her.’ Hannon puts 2.000 Guineas hopes Estidhkaar and Ivawood, the Middle Park Stakes runner-up, on Classic trial in Newbury’s one mile Greenham Stakes and Ivawood also has stamina questions to answer. McCoy will retire next week, but had been hoping for a final National success before Benvolio withdrew. McCoy finished fifth on favourite Shutthefrontdoor in last Saturday's Grand National.

After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board. The decision was made by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job. Andrew Strauss is also thought to be a possible candidate. England's failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand led to the decision.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Professor David Lerner, who led the study at the University of Sheffield's Faculty of Engineering, explained: ‘More than a million homes have their waste water incorrectly connected into the surface water network, which means their sewage is being discharged into a river, rather than going to a treatment plant. ‘Unfortunately, it's very difficult to detect where this is happening, as the discharge is intermittent, can't always be seen with the naked eye and existing tests are complex and expensive’ But now his team have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet (UV) light, because they absorb chemicals found in products containing ‘optical brighteners’ which are used to whiten and brighten colours. Professor Lerner said: ‘Often the only way to be sure a house is misconnected is through a dye test - putting dye down a sink or toilet and seeing where the coloured water appears in the sewer.’ ‘It's clearly impractical for water companies to do this for all the households they supply, but by working back from where pollution is identified and narrowing it down to a particular section of the network, the final step of identifying the source then becomes feasible.’ Pollutants found in domestic waste water change the bacterial and invertebrate life in rivers, encouraging pollutant tolerant species and leading to the build-up of 'sewage fungus', which is visible as a grey lining to the river bed. Tampons absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper, laundry detergents and shampoos, which glow under UV light. This means they could shed light on previously undetectable misplumbed pathways. The technique was trialled in the field by suspending tampons for three days in sixteen surface water outlets running into streams and rivers in Sheffield. The scientists found that nine of the tampons glowed, confirming the presence of optical brighteners - and therefore sewage pollution.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all.\n",

'I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters and that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.' Groundbreaking: Mrs Clinton has the chance to become the first female president in American history, which would make former President Clinton as the 'First Man' The Bill effect: Mrs Clinton is ahead in the polls and it is thought that the Democrats would like to see her run for the White House. The 68-year-old told Town & Country Magazine that he believes he has lost his natural flair for political campaigning. He added that becoming a grandparent to his daughter Chelsea's six-month-old daughter Charlotte has tamed the angry side of his personality.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Scientists have discovered an Achilles’ heel of prostate (pictured) cancer that could lead to better treatment for many  men diagnosed with the disease . These cells are the ‘root’ of the cancer and for a treatment to work, they should be destroyed. Lead study author Professor Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: ‘We gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body. British scientists have discovered an ‘Achilles’ heel’ in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments. The disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the UK, with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body. The latest study gets to the root of this spread, and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness. Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around theBody in ten affected men. Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises.\n",

Asked whether Oscar is struggling, as he was substituted at half-time, Mourinho said: ‘No, I don’t think he had a bad performance, I just think he was not good enough, which is a huge difference. When some people write that Fabregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists are probably not the same because the player that he assists does not score.’ ‘Matic, he was suspended, and after the suspension he was injured celebrating in the final, so he went back and he was not in the best condition. Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar have struggled in recent weeks. But Jose Mourinho insists he will stick by his midfielders.

One week before brain surgery she found out she was pregnant. Doctors warned Ms Hines that the baby would not survive being under general anaesthetic for 12 hours if she had the operation. They also warned her that if she kept the baby, her pregnancy hormones would likely cause the tumour to grow significantly. But she decided to push ahead with the pregnancy. She gave birth to her son Noah on October 16, 2012. Seven weeks after Noah was born she had surgery to remove her tumour. After her surgery she suffered another seizure at the gym.\n",

Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. In this, the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I recall when a hard man could take no more. Sugar Ray Leonard v Roberto Duran raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing.\n",

Very strict rules govern the reporting of UK elections, but until they kick in, here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates, what are the issues, who's likely to win, why bacon sandwiches matter, what is \"UKIP\" and, if the Queen isn't in charge, what does she do? Political apathy is on the rise in the UK, with many younger voters expressing disillusionment with party leaders they say are out of touch and barely distinguishable from one another, even if one \"looks like a panda\" and the other a \"pink condom.\" UK voters go to the polls on Thursday in an election that could change the political landscape. Queen Elizabeth II is officially Britain's head of state, but she's only nominally in charge.\n",

I said it before (Saturday's 2-1 win at Bolton) we had five left and we had to win every one. Elsewhere in the Football League this week, Bristol City will be Championship-bound with a win at Bradford City, while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's Burton Albion side and Shrewsbury could leave League Two behind them if they triumph against Carlisle and Bury respectively — and other results go their way. Two points separate four teams, with four games remaining. To drop points would almost certainly mean to drop out of the race for the two automatic slots to the Barclays Premier League. Middlesbrough were top on Good Friday but are fourth going into the visit of Wolves. Wolves are seven points behind Boro but only outside the play-offs on goal difference.\n",

But Captain Rahmani is resolute and says she eventually aims to become a flight instructor to inspire other women and in spite of the Taliban's threats says she remains determined to continue her career in the Afghan Air Force and work as frequently as her security situation permits.

England's latest star Harry Kane was recently micro-managed by the FA to not speak in media mixed zones . Sky Sports will pay £11million a game to broadcast Premier League football for three years starting in 2016.

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Lionel Messi opened the scoring for Barcelona with a curling strike on the half hour. Luis Suarez doubled the Catalans lead with a similar left-footed strike. Marc Bartra added a third with a headed goal on 75minutes. Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top of La Liga with just eight matches to play.\n",

NHS handed out 404,500 prescriptions for suncream at a cost of £13million in 2014. 4.7million prescriptions for indigestion pills cost £29million, damning analysis found.

      "  Combined Summary: The flows of migrants across the Mediterranean are unlikely to stop -- Italian authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in Libya are waiting to cross, following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in Italy last year. If your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in Australia each year, then \"no advantage\" (meaning no asylum in Australia) and \"stop the boats\" (including the turning back of boats in international waters) has worked. The Australian government's interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat, and then their relocation to Nauru or Papua New Guinea (or perhaps Cambodia), does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that Australia has to these populations. The number of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean this year has increased by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year.

It was my view then and remains so that Rosberg was marginally more to blame for the collision, but that it was no more than a racing incident. Webber, a feisty competitor and a talented driver, was a genuine threat to Vettel in their first season fighting for the title, as Rosberg was to Hamilton in their intitial championship contest. Nico Rosberg finished second to Lewis Hamilton at the Chinese Grand Prix. The German driver blamed the Brit for slowing down and bunching him up. Rosberg's attitude seems to have changed in the aftermath of his crash with Hamilton in Spa last August. The 17-year-old Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Max Verstappen showed he has what it takes.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Ben Standen, from estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff of Truro, said Smugglers Cottage in Smugglers Cove, near Portreath, has a summer and winter cottage, cleverly linked via a lift. Mr Standen said: ‘The fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years.’ The scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline, but interest in the programme, based on Winston Graham’s Poldark historical novels, set in the 18th century, is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost. The town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from Cornwall Council at the start of 2013. Beachfront property with spectacular views has gone on the market for £3million. It is overlooking an ancient smugglers’ cove on Cornwall’s north coast. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the property has direct access to the beach. Estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in Cornwall since Poldark began airing last month.\n",

A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. The trial at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being deliberately driven into the side of buses so 'injured' passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives in on the scam - could falsely claim from insurers . John Smith, 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales, stage-managed several collisions in a £1m 'crash for cash' scam. The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers. The crashes took place between October 2010 and January 2012 and earned ringleader Smith £159,000. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: But it is a mystery as to how the vast carved stones were transported into position. This map shows the location of the 887 statues, which gaze inland across the island, with an average height of 13ft (four metres) It may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a ‘hat’ into place, because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again, but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards. Walk the walk: A team of experts created a five-tonne replica of one of the statues and moved it into an upright position on a dirt path in Hawaii, to prove that the statues could have been 'walked' into place . Physicists at the University of Oregon used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a Moai’s head. They concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukaos means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp. This is despite the largest pukas measuring six-and-a-half feet (two metres) in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes (1,890 stone) Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth\n",

The 'affluent healthy elderly' was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption. Scientists at Sheffield University have identified six different types of obese person. The distinction, they hope, will allow for tailor-made treatments to help different obese people combat their weight. Researchers analysed people with a body mass index of 30 or more - a recognised measure of obesity. They found obese people fall into one of six categories: . The 'heavy drinking males' were less likely to be managing their weight, though did report above average levels of physical exercise and walking.

Nadal broke in the sixth game of the match to go 4-2 up, and a shanked backhand from the world No 108 handed him another break and the first set. It is too early to say that the king of clay is back to his best, and he will face sterner tests later in the week, but he could not have asked for a better opening display. Rafael Nadal beat Lucas Pouille 6-2, 6-1 in the Monte Carlo Masters. Nadal is an eight-time champion at Monte Carlo but hasn't won the tournament since 2012.

In 1969 President Nixon wanted to appoint her to the post of US representative to the UN so the FBI carried out a full background check, which included everything from her credit history to interviews with former teachers. President Bush said at the time that he and his wife were mourning the loss of an 'American icon'. John Agar told an agent in 1969 to think twice because Temple would 'overreact' if she didn't get her way. He also said that her mother had wrecked their marriage because she interfered in their affairs too much. His efforts were unsuccessful as dozens of other people including Ronald Reagan came to Temple's defense and called her a 'very courageous woman of the highest morals'\n",

      "  Combined Summary: The Clinton Foundation was barred by an agreement from accepting money from foreign governments it wasn't already in business while Mrs. Clinton was in President Barack Obama's cabinet. 'But I think people are going to be blown away by the details in this book and how they link the Clintons into this enormous exchange of money from foreign countries, from donors to companies, and then it's all swirling around,' he told Hannity. 'And I don't think it would happen if you didn't have somebody who was a secretary of state and a former president, and they seem to be capitalizing on their service in government,' he contended. A Reuters investigation that revealed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had misreported millions of dollars in donations from foreign nations led the global charity to announce that it would refile more than five years of tax documents. The discovery came as separate financial reviews found that previously unreported foreign businesses either donated money directly to the family foundation or paid Bill to speak while their countries were doing official business with the State Department during Hillary's tenure. 'Add your name if you agree Hillary Clinton should return all money raised from foreign nation!' Ted Cruz said in a Facebook post soliciting names for a petition urging the non-profit to give back the funds\n",

This has been a topsy-turvy season for the 23-year-old, who has yet to reach the heights he scaled when he first burst onto the international scene. Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson has, however, kept faith with the Tottenham winger - belief he paid back in quite exceptional fashion at the Juventus Stadium. Andros Townsend scored England's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night.

      "  Combined Summary: Benik Afobe’s first-half finish kept Wolves slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10-man Wigan to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the DW Stadium. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season – but only just. However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game in the 25th minute. The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence. The result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football's third-tier.\n",

Sir David Nicholson is the latest expert to warn that Ed Miliband’s plans will not provide enough cash to keep the service going.

And according to this new research, when the 11-year cycle combines with the two-year cycle, the solar storms that pummel Earth's atmosphere can be amplified. Shown here are images of the sun over one cycle showing changes in its activity . Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle. Every two years it appears 'bands' of magnetic field move to the surface. This combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle, causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares that can endanger Earth. The bands, which appear in each hemisphere of the sun, cause the solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Compared to the less silver tongued among us, the super speakers – which also included a barrister and a radio presenter – showed less activity in a key area of the brain involved articulating and comprehending speech. Stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic. They were compared against a control group of students, who, according to Dr Devlin, were far less adept at the task. Super speakers showed less activity in an area of the brain known as Broca's region. This suggests they are putting less effort into the basic mechanics of speech. It may also explain why some people dry up completely when asked to speak. Brain scans of 17 professional comedians, a radio presenter and a barrister were carried out.\n",

Mr Clegg dismissed as 'ludicrous' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the Lib Dems to stop the SNP if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in Labour's box in seats where Ed Miliband's party is battling the nationalists. Mr Clegg said it was 'possible' that the Lib Dems could come out of the election with more seats than Labour in Scotland because of the damage the SNP surge could inflict on Mr Miliband's party. Former Scottish First Minister hopes to make a return to the Commons. Salmond has chosen to stand in the Gordon constituency, where veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down.

      "  Combined Summary: When high-energy electrons and ions from the sun hit Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras. And now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras, by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space. The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere. Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth. They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space. It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere. A beam fired from the machine would create auroras - and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere. For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it. But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it.\n",

At the end of the hearing the Coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of Zaki's death and its link to Ms Oettinger's health didn't undo work to end stigma around mental illness. '[But] I fear that the stigma of depression and mental illness will grow as a result of events such as these. Donna Oettinger, 41, and her son Zaki died on train tracks in March 2013. She had attempted to kill herself three months before the tragedy. Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family.

      "  Combined Summary: While Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport, in Pakistan, is often cited as the worst in the world, there are a surprising number of complaints form travellers about well-known hubs ranging from LAX in Los Angeles to London Luton. Queues are never a holidaymaker's best idea of fun, but it appears some airports don't help themselves when faced with these kind of situations (pictured is Los Angeles Airport) From the long queues for security, to paying for internet connectivity that doesn't work and fighting for a seat in the terminal, the allegations against these well-known airports are varied, infuriating travellers while they await their connection. To be delayed at LaGuardia is 'mind numbing' according to research attained by sleepingatairports.net . LAX is America's second busiest airport in terms of passengers handled each year, beaten only by Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport. Travellers complain about the layout, lack of restaurants, activities and services for the layover traveller, and the general uncleanliness of the airport.\n",

Loeb has said he believes \"life begins at fertilization\" and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said.

      "  Combined Summary: The district attorney's office told the judge Wednesday that their forensic experts couldn't determine if six crime scene bullets — which were the crux of the evidence against Hinton at an expected retrial — came from a gun investigators took from his home. Stevenson has been arguing for 16 years that Hinton was innocent and that he was at his job at a warehouse when the crimes were committed. 'Due to insufficient corresponding individual microscopic characteristics, all three experts found that they could not conclusively determine that any of the six bullets were or were not fired through the same firearm or that they were fired through the firearm recovered from (Hinton's home),'  the motion continues. Anthony Ray Hinton was convicted of two 1985 murders that occurred during robberies of fast-food restaurants near Birmingham. Prosecutors linked Hinton to the killings through a .38-caliber revolver found at his house. The U.S. Supreme Court last year sent Hinton's case back for a potential new trial, which prompted a re-examination of the evidence. The experts were unable to tie the gun to the bullets used at the crime scene. Hinton will be released from the Jefferson County Jail on Friday morning.\n",

Not one. In convicting Demjanjuk as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor death camp, the Munich court concluded that death camp guards, regardless of how they had conducted themselves, had to be accessories to murder, because that was their job. Oskar Gröning is accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 Jews during his service at Auschwitz. The refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of Holocaust trials. John Demjanjuk remained defiantly silent during his 18-month trial, never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: Yesterday’s discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: ‘Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically – look at Alaska, for instance – but that has never worried the oil industry.’ Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was ‘an excellent start to the exploration campaign’. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in ‘ageing infrastructure’ and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system. Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina. After nine months of exploratory drilling, a group of British companies found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands. The bonanza, which could be worth billions of pounds, will add to fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory.\n",

Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. ‘I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,’ said United’s head coach. Michael Owen has claimed Newcastle would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies are seven points off the Premier League relegation zone.

She was one of a number of pupils who the previous day had observed the nationally recognized Day Of Silence, an event aimed at drawing attention to gay and lesbian bullying and harassment in schools. It is estimated that somewhere between 50 and 100 students took part in the Anti-Gay event and many openly shared photos on social media of them dressed in their flannel shirts. McGuffey High School in Pennsylvania is attracting national media attention for all the wrong reasons. A group of students organized a so-called Anti-Gay Day protest, with future events scheduled. Organizers encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt to school and writing 'Anti-Gay' on their hands. The event was held last Thursday and students report that openly gay pupils also had Bible verses pined to their lockers and were physically bullied.\n",

'If our Nanna's product was the source, the lack of laboratory findings from the testing conducted by Patties Foods for the presence of E.coli, Coliforms or HAV indicates there has been no systemic failure,' he said in a statement on Wednesday. The company said one of two opened sample packs from consumers who contracted hepatitis A did test positive for HAV in health department testing but it may have been open to contamination. Patties Foods says its testing has found no link between its Nanna's brand frozen mixed berries and a national hepatitis A outbreak. The health department continues to investigate how 34 people in six states contracted the hepatitis A virus. Four adults, three in Victoria and one in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after condsuming the 1kg packets. The product contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. No evidence of HAV or E.coli was found in re-tests of all batches of frozen berries that were not subject to the recall.\n",

Lille were struggling at one point in the season and he is only a young player, but from what I have seen of him in training he is a very good player and will do really well for us. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet has backed Divock Origi to be a success at Anfield. The 19-year-old joined Liverpool after impressing at last summer's World Cup but was loaned back to Lille for this season.

Hummels and Gundogan are likely to be lining up in red for United next year if Van Gaal gets his way . A powerful figure at the base of Dortmund's midfield, Gundogan might normally have cost a sizeable chunk of Van Gaal's £150m summer budget but could be prised away for as little as £15m, given the time left on his contract.

Official figures, released in February by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show there was a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the year to September last year, equal to the population of a city roughly the size of Nottingham and up from 210,000 in the previous 12 months. The increase in net migration was driven by a 'statistically significant' rise in immigrants arriving in the UK - up to 624,000 in the year to September 2014 from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. More than 231 million immigrants live around the world, according to new data. More than 7.8 million of these live in the UK and Northern Ireland. U.S., Russia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, UK and France also have high numbers. Countries with fewest immigrants include Morocco, Mongolia and Greenland.\n",

Professor Andrew Pitsillides, who co-led the research at the Royal Veterinary College in London, said: ‘These initial results are very positive for such an experiment and we have convinced ourselves that sulforaphane is a promising agent for the treatment of osteoarthritis. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment (file picture) 'There is no cure or effective treatment for the disease other than pain relief or joint replacement, so the potential for SFX-01 is massive.’ Broccoli is also believed to reduce the risk of some cancers and cardiovascular disease, and improve symptoms of autism. Broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with arthritis. But patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit. Sulforadex in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine.

A spokeswoman for the EPA said the DPNR has been cooperative in this investigation. \"If they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes, which is the only legal way they could use it, and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings, that's a clear and malice violation of the law,\" Mapp said.

      "  Combined Summary: The driver of the car, a 16-year-old girl, was thrown from the car and trapped underneath for more than four hours after it veered off the road and dropped 100ft from a cliff landing on top of her (above scenes from the wreckage) Depression visible: It took emergency services around five hours to pull the teen driver, who has not been identified, from the wreckage and she only suffered minor injuries (above the four-door sedan after it landed upside down) The driver of the car is believed to have only suffered minor injuries because of a depression in the roof of the car that created a space between the roof and the ground that enveloped her after the car flipped over and landed. This apparently stopped the full weight of the car from bearing down on her. The two passengers, aged 16 and 17, who have also not been identified, managed to climb up to the road and were taken to hospital with what appears to be non-life threatening injuries . The driver, who has not been identified, was trapped under the car for more than four hours during the incident that occurred on Wednesday. It took dozens of emergency responders from multiple agencies about five hours to extricate the girl. The two other passengers, aged 16 and 17, managed to climb up to the road and were taken to hospital with what appears to be non-life threatening injuries.\n",

      "  Combined Summary: But the IMF predicted that there will still be a deficit of £7billion that year – even after a decade of austerity. But it also raises the prospect of even higher borrowing under a Labour government. Speaking at the launch of the Fiscal Monitor in Washington, Mr Gaspar said: ‘Countries that fail to build buffers in good times often find themselves without fiscal space to manage a crisis and that is very costly.’ The bleak projections for the UK public finances come despite the IMF hailing ‘solid’ economic growth in the UK. International Monetary Fund said state will continue to spend more on public services than it raises in tax. Projection underlines how hard it will be for next government to eliminate deficit. Tories have pledged to return Britain to the black in 2018-19 with a surplus of £5.2billion – the first since 2001.\n",

What's more, many of those whose secrets Smith is spilling are from her closest friends, including Barry Diller, who she claims asked her over 20 years ago: 'Do you think I should come out?' Lee Radziwill, known by most as the sister of Jackie Kennedy Onasis but some as the mother-in-law of Real Housewives of New York star and author Carole Radziwill, landed on Smith's bad side when she refused to help their friend Truman Capote after he was taken to court by Gore Vidal. Liz Smith, 92, is spilling celebrity secrets that she never printed over the course of her 70 year career. She claims IAC chairman Barry Diller asked her in 1992: 'Do you think I should come out?' but that he 'worships' his wife Diane Von Furstenberg. The gossip columnist claims she advised Diller, the chairman of media company IAC, against it, telling him; 'No, Barry, David Geffen needs to come out.

The diver says that after a successful launch in Australia, she was then  'hunted down' by US retailer Urban Outfitters, who chased the brand for an adult range of the fins. Mahina said she is already working on her next product, set to be released in time for next summer, and can't believe how lucky she is to have found something she is so passionate about. The Merfin is a monofin made from recycled rubber. It lets you experience what it might be like to swim like a mermaid. The product is the brainchild of Australian professional freediver Kazzie Mahina. The fins come in four sizes, ranging from child's to adult's.

Trial: Former national security chief Zhou Yongkang is embroiled in the biggest corruption case since Mao Zedong's widow (pictured right) went on trial with the rest of the 'Gang of Four' So the move to announce charges against Zhou is being touted by official media as proof that the leadership is determined to take action – although some commentators argue that it is simply a sign of internal divisions and score-settling between factions in the party. If the trial proceeds as expected he will be the most senior politician to face court since the sensational 1981 trial of Chairman Mao's widow, his fourth and last wife Jiang Qing, and the rest of the 'Gang of Four' over claims they persecuted political opponents during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Zhou Yongkang is accused of corruption and leaking of state secrets. He is likely to be found guilty, and could be executed.

      "  Combined Summary: Tarnished star: Kim Richards leaving the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, where she had an emotionally-charged interview with Dr Phil McGraw after her arrest last week. She was overheard to say it's on the beach, it's local and she would be able to go to Brooke's wedding. She claimed on the show that she only had one incident, when she was in a great deal of pain from an ulcer and Monty gave her a mystery pill to help as she had to go film early in the season. The hysterical Real Housewife broke down in tears and went into full meltdown as observers revealed she bolted from the room where Dr Phil had offered to help place her in a top treatment program. Richards apparently snubbed Dr Phil's offer of help as eyewitnesses in the hallway heard her scream 'F***', and other obscenities when she ran out of the room and down the hall. Richards, 50, was arrested last week and charged with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting an officer and battery on a police officer following a drunken incident at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n",
